You will learn how to do the following:
	•Describe AWS Cloud security and the shared responsibility model.
	•Identify the security responsibilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS) compared with the security responsibilities of the customer.
	
This module provides an introduction to the AWS shared responsibility model. 



AWS support plan pricing varies by plan, with 
Basic support being free. 
The paid plans—
	Developer, 
	Business, 
	Enterprise On-Ramp, and 
	Enterprise
	Developer starts at \(\$29\) or 3% of monthly charges, 
	Business starts at \(\$100\) or 10% of monthly charges up to \(\$10K\), and 
	Enterprise starts at \(\$15,000\) per month.

aws S3 [Simple Storage Service] is one of the storage

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

Amazon S3 is designed for 11 9s (99.999999999 percent) of durability
per account can create upto 10,000 general purpose buckets
in single bucket can store unlimited objects 
Storage capacity is virtually unlimited. max size of single object is 5-Tib
Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), and hyphens (-).
Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.

•By default, your data is private, and you can optionally encrypt it.
•Data is stored redundantly.
•You can retrieve data anytime from anywhere over the internet.
•Bucket names must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3

S3 access via 
	AWS Management Console
	AWS CLI
	AWS SDKs
	REST endpoints
	
to crate s3 in regions wise and access via global

use cases
standard :
	websites, applications and content distribution (cdn)
	Frequently accessed documents or media files
	bigdata analytics that need quick access
	
Intelligent-tiering:
	long-term storage where access frequency is unpredicatable
	data with unknown or changing access patterns

S3-standard-IA:
	Backup files,DR disaster recovery data
	data accessed a few times per moths or less
	
one zone-IA:
	Non-critical backup or re-creatable data
	secondary copies or data easily reproduced
	
Instant Retrieval:
	Archive media,documents or compliance data
	Medical images or research data accesses rarely but quickly when needed


Flexible Retrieval:
	long-term archives, compliance data, backup archives
	DR data accessed rarely

S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
	cloud archives (data that must be retained but almost ever used)
	7-10 years retention

Pay for only what you use:
	•GBs per month
	•Transfer out to other Regions
	•PUT, COPY, POST, LIST, and GET requests
	
You do not have to pay for the following:
	•Transfer in to Amazon S3
	•Transfer out from Amazon S3 to Amazon CloudFront or Amazon EC2 in the same Region


 estimate Amazon S3 costs, consider the following factors:
 
 •Storage class type 
 –Standard storage is designed for the following:»11 9s of durability»4 9s of availability
 –Standard-Infrequent Access (S-IA) is designed for the following:»11 9s of durability»3 9s of availability
 	•Amount of storage
 	–The number and size of objects
 	•Requests
 	–The number and type of requests (GET, PUT, COPY)
 	–Type of requests: »There are different rates for GET requests than other requests.
 	•Data transfer
 	–Pricing is based on the amount of data that is transferred out of the Amazon S3 Region.
 	–Data transfer in is free, but you incur charges for data that is transferred out
